Dsigned for personal use on my photoblog, [tyler.camera](http://tyler.camera).

Seattle is a Wordpress photoblog theme based built on [Underscores](http://underscores.me/).

## Support

This is a free WordPress theme, and provided as is. Meaning, I can not assist in helping you get it setup. In the future I may provide a premium version with additional support. Until then, if you believe youâ€™ve encountered a bug, feel free to open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/underlost/_seattle/issues).
