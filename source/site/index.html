        <p>Seattle is a photo blog theme for WordPress. It was built from the ground up, using the fantastic <a href="http://underscores.me/">Underscores</a> starter theme from Automatic (the company behind WordPress). I don&#8217;t blog that often on here, so I wanted the focus to really be on photos and other media uploads. It is, however, versatile enough that it can be used for just about anything. All posts can have a featured image, which can change the visual appearance of any given post, depending on it&#8217;s format. For example, Quotes and image type posts will have a scalable faded background. </p>
