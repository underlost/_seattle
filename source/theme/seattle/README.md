Seattle Wordpress Theme
=======

Originally designed for personal use on my photoblog, [tyler.camera](http://tyler.camera).

Seattle is a Wordpress photoblog theme based built on [Underscores](http://underscores.me/).

## Getting Started

- Copy the 'seattle' folder located in 'source/theme/' to your themes directory in WordPress.
- Login to the WordPress dashboard. Under *Appearances > Themes*, click to enable the theme.
- The theme does provide some basic customization options for the header area. This can be setup under *Appearances > Customize*.

## Example

For a live, working demo in action, visit my personal photo blog running the theme: [tyler.camera](http://tyler.camera/).

## Support

This is a free WordPress theme, and provided as is. Meaning, I can not assist in helping you get it setup. In the future I may provide a premium version with additional support. Until then, if you believe youâ€™ve encountered a bug, feel free to open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/underlost/seattle/issues).

## License

Seattle is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/underlost/seattle/blob/master/LICENSE).
